h1. Setup: Table prefix

You only need to use a table prefix if you require multiple Textpattern installations in one database. Each installation needs a unique prefix.

Note that the prefix must adhere to the following naming rules:

# *1st character:* must be a-z, A-Z, or underscore
# *Subsequent characters:* can only be a-z, A-Z, 0-9, or underscore
