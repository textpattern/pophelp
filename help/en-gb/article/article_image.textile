h1. Articles: Article image

If you would like to associate a single image with this article, place one of the following here:

# a Textpattern image ID
# a relative URL to the image (e.g., @/images/my_pic.jpg@)
# a fully-qualified URL (e.g., @http://example.com/path/to/images/my_pic.jpg@)

The image can be displayed by placing a @<txp:article_image />@ tag inside an article form. It will output a complete HTML @<img>@ tag to your chosen image.
