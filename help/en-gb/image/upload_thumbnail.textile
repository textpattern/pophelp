h1. Images: Upload thumbnail

Full size images can be assigned their own thumbnails. These are useful for linking to - and the indexing of - full size images.

A reference to the thumbnail is exactly the same as the reference to the full size image, with @t@ appended to the file name. For example, to reference a thumbnail associated with a full size image stored at @/images/12.jpg@ you would use @/images/12t.jpg@.
