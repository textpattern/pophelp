h1. Articles: Categories

Unlike sections, which define the navigational structure of a site, article categories allow organization of articles by their subject matter. Once categories are assigned, lists of articles belonging to particular categories can be browsed.

For example, likely article categories on a site about food might be:

* raw ingredients
* shopping
* recipes
* presentation
* restaurants
* chefs
