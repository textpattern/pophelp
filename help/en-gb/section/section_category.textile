h1. Sections: Introduction

Sections in Textpattern are perhaps best thought of as analogous to sections in a newspaper; each belong to the same publication, but each might feature a different layout, or a different style of article, and so on.

For most websites, only a bare minimum of sections need be created.

*A likely scenario for a website with three sections:*

# *Archive:* The 'Section' to which all articles that appear on the front page belong. Whenever a reader clicks on an article's permanent link, it will be displayed in the page layout assigned to this 'Section'. To go to a paged list of the most recent articles assigned to the section "Archive", the URL would be @http://example.com/archive/@.
# *About:* An 'about this site' page, which differs from the front page and the "Archive" section, in that it is more static, may have a different layout, and will likely contain only one article. The "About" section would be reached at @http://example.com/about/@.
# *Photos:* A 'Section' whose differing layout (and possibly different CSS) would display photos instead of articles.

Note that a special hidden section, named default, always exists. This default section uses the page named default and the style called default, and it constructs the front page of your site.
