h1. Sections: Default publishing section

This option governs which section will be pre-selected in the Section menu when creating a new article on the Write tab.

If most of your articles end up belonging to a particular section, select it from the list here. Changes will be reflected immediately.

You can override this per article in the Write tab by selecting a different section in the 'Sort and display' pane.
