h1. Textile: Abbreviations

HTML allows authors to define abbreviations via the @<abbr>@ tag. The definition appears as a tooltip when a cursor hovers over the abbreviation. A crucial aid to clear writing, this should be used at least once for each abbreviation in documents where they appear.

To quickly define an abbreviation in Textile, place the full text in (parentheses) immediately following the abbreviation.

Example:

bc. ACLU(American Civil Liberties Union)

Will become:

bc. <abbr title="American Civil Liberties Union">ACLU</abbr>

Which, when rendered by a browser, will appear like this (move your cursor over the text):

ACLU(American Civil Liberties Union)

p(alert-block information). *Note:* In Textile versions prior to v2.5.0, the older @<acronym>@ tag is used for abbreviations. This tag has been deprecated in HTML5 in favour of the @<abbr>@ tag.
