h1. Textile: Deleted text

Use ==-hyphens-== around text that has been -deleted-. This is useful in marking changes from one version of a document to the next.

The @<del>@ HTML tag is applied:

bc. -a phrase- â†’ <del>a phrase</del>

p(alert-block information). *Note:* Quick tags must open and close within a single paragraph to produce valid markup.
