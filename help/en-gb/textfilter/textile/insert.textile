h1. Textile: Inserted text

Use ==+pluses+== around text that has been +inserted+. This is useful in marking changes from one version of a document to the next.

The @<ins>@ HTML tag is applied:

bc. +a phrase+ â†’ <ins>a phrase</ins>

p(alert-block information). *Note:* Quick tags must open and close within a single paragraph to produce valid markup.
