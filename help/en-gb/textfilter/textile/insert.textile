h1. Textile: Inserted text

Use ==+pluses+== around text that has been +inserted+. This is useful in marking changes from one version of a document to the next.

The <code><ins></code> HTML tag is applied:

bc. +a phrase+ → <ins>a phrase</ins>

p(alert-block information). *Note:* Quick tags must open and close within a single paragraph to produce valid markup.
