h1. Textile: Strong emphasis

Use ==*asterisks*== for text to be *strongly emphasised*.

The @<strong>@ HTML tag is applied:

bc. *a phrase* → <strong>a phrase</strong>

If the text is not meant to have *structural* emphasis, but simply to be styled in **bold** (e.g., as a design element) use double asterisks:

bc. **a phrase** → <b>a phrase</b>

p(alert-block information). *Note:* Quick tags must open and close within a single paragraph to produce valid markup.
