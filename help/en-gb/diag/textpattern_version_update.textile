h1. Diagnostics: Textpattern CMS version update

There is a newer version of Textpattern CMS available. To take advantage of the latest features and security, it is recommended you upgrade.

Please note that while we strive to make the upgrade experience as seamless and pain-free as possible:

* If only the last digit differs from your current version, the upgrade is likely to be backwards compatible with plugins and themes.
* If the last two digits differ from your current version, the upgrade might require updates to some plugins and/or themes, although it will probably continue to work anyway in a limited capacity.
* If the first digit is different from your current version, the upgrade is likely to require updates to most plugins and themes. If you rely heavily on a particular plugin or theme feature, please check with the author or community members before commencing the upgrade.

If the messages reads "There is a problem trying to connect to the RPC server" it means a new version could not be checked at this time (the server may be down). Updates are checked every 24 hours so it is likely that next time you visit the Diagnostics panel, all will be well.
