h1. Diagnostics: Your PHP installation is missing the mail() function

PHP's "mail":http://php.net/manual/en/function.mail.php function is disabled. Therefore Textpattern cannot send emails, and some functionality will not be available. For example, email notifications for new comments will not be sent, and new users will not receive a welcome email. Users can still be added, however.
