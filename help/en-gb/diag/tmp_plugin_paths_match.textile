h1. Diagnostics: Plugins and tmp dirs should not match

Plugins should have their own directory and not share the @tmp@ directory. This is a potential security risk and may adversely affect your site if the temporary directory is flushed. Please ensure that the @tmp@ directory path is different to the @plugin_cache@ path.
