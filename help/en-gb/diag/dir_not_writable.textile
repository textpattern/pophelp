h1. Diagnostics: Directory is not writable

To use the file and image upload capabilities, these directories have to be writable by PHP. Usually this means you have to change permissions to @755@. This can be done with your FTP client, or alternatively on the command line by issuing a @chmod 755 /path/to/dir@ command.
