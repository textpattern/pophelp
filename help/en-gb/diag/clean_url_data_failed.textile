h1. Diagnostics: Clean URL data failed

It appears that either your site URLs (@example.com/section/article@) are currently not working or your server does not support the test procedure to determine if clean URLs work or not; if clean URLs on your site work, you can safely ignore this message.

If clean URLs are _not_ working it may mean either:

# your 'Site URL' setting is incorrect, or the page at that address is not managed by this copy of Textpattern.
# your server requires some changes to @.htaccess@ in order to make clean URLs work.
# your server doesn't support clean URLs at all.

The clean URL test attempts to fetch a page from the web address specified in the 'Site URL' preference in order to check that all clean URL parameters are working correctly. If that URL is a different site, or has been replaced with a static page or similar, the test will fail. Until the issue is resolved you will have to use messy URLs on your site instead (@example.com?s=section&id=4@). Ensure the 'Permanent link mode' in Admin Preferences is set accordingly.

Note that using a plugin to put a site in 'maintenance mode' may trigger this warning.
