h1. Diagnostics: Modified files

If any files in the Textpattern installation are different to those expected, the files will be highlighted here. This is not necessarily a problem, but may be worth checking out if you are having problems with the functionality of your site. Files are determined to be modified if their respective checksum differs from the known-good checksum list.
