h1. Preferences: Spam blocklists (comma-separated)

The "blocklist":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blacklist providers entered here will be queried when a comment is posted to your blog, and the IP address of the comment poster will be checked. If the IP address is listed it means there has been one or more spamming complaints made about this IP in the past, and the comment will be rejected.

Additionally, checks on approved comments will take place when an article is viewed on the front-side. If you encounter slowness when displaying articles with comments, consider disabling spam blocklists by removing the blocklist provider(s).

You can enter a list of domain names here, seperated by commas. Potential blocklists can be found via "dmoz":http://www.dmoz.org/Computers/Internet/E-mail/Spam/Blacklists/List_of_Major_Blacklists/, but be aware that it is *your* responsibility to make sure you can trust those blocklist providers before you add any.
