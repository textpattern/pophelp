h1. Preferences: Comments on by default?

If this is set to 'Yes', comments will be automatically allowed for every article published. If set to 'No', you must enable comments on the article 'Write' tab each time you want to accept comments.

Note that allowing comments can be turned on or off at any time, on a per-article basis.
