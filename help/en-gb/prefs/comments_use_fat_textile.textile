h1. Preferences: Allow more Textile markup in comments?

When set to 'Yes', comments may contain "Textile":http://textpattern.com/textile-sandbox elements which would otherwise be treated as plain text, such as:

* headings
* ordered and unordered lists
* footnotes
* tables
* code
* extended block syntax (@bc..@, @bq..@, etc.)

p(alert-block information). *Note:* For security reasons, raw HTML is transformed into regular text.
