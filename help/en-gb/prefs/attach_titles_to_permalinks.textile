h1. Preferences: Attach titles to permalinks?

This setting will attach a dirified version of the article title to the URL. It is either generated automatically or can be manually overriden in the 'Advanced options' when editing an article.

The setting will only have an effect when you are using clean URLs. For certain languages this may result in long and ugly URLs, in which case you probably want to set this to 'Off'.
