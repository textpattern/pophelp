h1. Preferences: SMTP envelope sender address

This preference should be left blank unless you experience problems with sending email in Textpattern (if no email is sent at all). Should that problem arise, you can enter any valid email address here, although preferably one that has the same domain name as the website where you've installed Textpattern (i.e., if your website is http://example.com, you might use 'you@example.com').

For those interested in the technical details:

* On UNIX/Mac OS servers, the entered email address is used as the 4th parameter (prefixed with "-f") for the PHP @mail()@ function
* On Windows servers, the entered email address is used to set (or override) the @sendmail_from@ php.ini setting

This ensures that the SMTP envelope sender address (which is not necessarily the same as the "From:" header you normally see in emails) is set to the email address you've entered here, which is a requirement for sending email on some web servers.
