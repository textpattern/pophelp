h1. Textile: Footnotes

Numeric references within text to footnotes appear between square brackets. Don't forget the corresponding footnote at the bottom of the page.

h3. Example

bc. This is covered elsewhere[1].

Will become:

bc. This is covered elsewhere<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>

Which, when rendered by a browser, will appear like this:

This is covered elsewhere[1].

To create the footnote that corresponds to its reference within the text, begin a new paragraph with @fn@ and the footnote's number, followed by a dot and a space:

bc. fn1. Down here, in fact.

Will become:

bc. <p id="fn1"><sup>1</sup> Down here, in fact.</p>

Which, when rendered by a browser, will appear like this:

fn1. Down here, in fact.
